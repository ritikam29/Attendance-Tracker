Tech Stack used in the project:

The project used face.api js which is a Javascript face recognition library which uses state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm and provide a high level API to perform tasks such as age prediction, gender prediction, face expression prediction, face detection, facial landmark detection and face recognition.

1.**ReactJS**-I have used React for building the frontend of the project.React provides high performance, cost-efficient development, modularity, reusable wrapper components, and other benefits for rapid development

2.**NodeJS** - The backend of the project is built using NodeJS. Node. js is very good at handling simultaneous connections. Since IoT is built on many devices sending small messages that must be handled quickly, Node. js makes a good backend for the application, providing serverless architecture and real-time communication support.

3.**MongoDB** - The extracted features are sent over to the server and stored into the database.As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy to store structured or unstructured data.

4.I have used **GraphQL** which basically helps in connecting the frontend and backend of the project. GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. The project also uses **Apollo Client** which is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.
